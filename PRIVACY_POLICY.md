# Privacy Policy for Daily Check-In

**Last Updated:** January 26, 2026

Daily Check-In ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is collected, used, and disclosed by likely when you use our mobile application (the "App").

## 1. Information We Collect

### a. Personal Information
We do not knowingly collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or phone number, unless you explicitly provide it to us for support purposes.

### b. Usage Data & Device Information
The App may collect anonymous usage data and device information (e.g., device model, operating system version) to help us improve the performance and stability of the App.

### c. Blockchain Data
If you use features of the App that interact with the blockchain (e.g., Solana), please be aware that all transactions are public and permanent on the blockchain. Your public wallet address and transaction history are visible to anyone. We do not control the blockchain and are not responsible for the privacy of data stored on it.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect solely to:
- Provide, maintain, and improve the App.
- Facilitate blockchain interactions (e.g., verifying check-ins).
- Debug technical issues.

## 3. Data Storage

### a. Local Storage
Most of your app data (such as local habits, preferences, and streak history unrelated to the blockchain) is stored locally on your device. We do not transmit this data to external servers.

### b. Blockchain Storage
Check-in proofs or other on-chain activities are stored on the blockchain and are immutable.

## 4. Third-Party Services

We may use third-party services (such as Expo for OTA updates) that may collect information used to identify your device. Please review the privacy policies of any third-party service providers we use.

## 5. Security

We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. However, no internet or blockchain transmission is completely secure.

## 6. Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 13.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
